# Simon-Game-Challenge
The Simon game is a classic electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, where players must repeat a sequence of flashing lights and sounds. Players are challenged to remember and repeat increasingly complex patterns, with the game testing their short-term memory and reflexes.
